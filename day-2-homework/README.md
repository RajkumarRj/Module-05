**Description:**

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - The HTML document declares the document type and sets the language to English.
   - The `<meta>` tags specify the character set and viewport settings.
   - The title of the web page is set to "Day-2-homework."

2. **Script and Style Loading:**
   - External scripts for React, ReactDOM, and Babel standalone are loaded from CDN sources.
   - A `<style>` tag includes some simple CSS to style the `#root` element, giving it a width of 50%, fitting its content height, and centering it horizontally.

3. **Body Content:**
   - The body of the HTML document contains a `<div>` with the ID "root." This div will be the target for rendering React components.

4. **JavaScript Section:**
   - The script type is set to "text/babel," indicating that the content inside should be treated as JSX and transpiled by Babel.
   - The `ReactDOM.createRoot` method is used to create a root instance.
   - JSX syntax is employed to define the structure of the web page within the `page` constant.
   - The `createRoot` instance's `render` method is used to render the JSX content into the specified "root" div.
